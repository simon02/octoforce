                In order to see what Octoforce can do, you need to write your very first post. Or copy-paste one of your previously written ones in here. After all, we are a very heavy cheerleader for recycling.

                Step 5 will introduce some other possibilities to get your existing content into Octoforce, but for now we will do it the old-school way: plain old typing.

      %h1.page-title
        Write Your Very First Post
      %h4.page-subtitle
        To make it easy, I already provided you with a simple example. Feel free to use this or type out your own.
      .page-subtitle
