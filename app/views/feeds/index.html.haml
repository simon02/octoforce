                  You can add any feed you want. Everytime an item is added to one of these feeds, we  receive a notification and add a fresh, newly minted post to your list.
                %h4 Wondering how you can use this?
                %p
                  You can add a feed to your own blog so everytime you publish a post, it will automatically be added to your content libray. You can easily change the text, add hashtags or mentions right here.
                %p
                  Another possibility is to add all your favorite blogs to a new list just for that purpose. Then once a while just check out this list and filter out the posts you don't want to share. You can copy the ones you like to other lists and enjoy the rest of the week knowing your content calendar is nicely filled up!
